CMA-TWEANN is free software that implements efficient algorithm to optimize neural 
network topology and weight parameters.

For further details, you may refer to our paper "CMA-TWEANN: Efficient Optimization of
Neural Networks via Self-adaptation and Seamless Augmentation" presented @ GECCO'12.

* Release note *
Jul. 16, 2012:
Bugs on individual ranking and damping parameters are fixed.

* Abstract *
CMA-TWEANN software is provided as header files.
The main header is "cmat.h".
Accompanying header "nn.h" is automatically included from cmat.h.

* File structure *
CMATWEANN
|-cmat.h: Main header file that should be included by a program that uses CMA-TWEANN
|-nn.h 
|
|-prob.h: Pole-balancing benchmark introduced in the GECCO paper
|-test.cpp: Test program that solves pole-balancing task using CMA-TWEANN
|
|-Eigen: Third party library for efficient linear algebra computation

* Usage *
Including "cmat.h" does everything.
cmat.h, nn.h, and Eigen library should be located as described above.

Sample program in test.cpp is a good starting point to understand the usage of cmat.h.
